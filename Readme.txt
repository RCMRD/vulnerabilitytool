About Project
Background
Malawi has not been spared from the severe impacts of climate change. In the last two decades, Malawi has experienced a number of adverse climatic hazards. The most serious ones have been dry spells, seasonal droughts, intense and unpredictable rainfall, riverine floods and flash floods. Some of these especially droughts and floods, have since increased in frequency, intensity and magnitude over the past decades, and have adversely impacted on food and water security, water quality, energy and sustainable livelihoods of most rural communities. With its narrow economic base, limited agro-processing industries, over-dependency on rain-fed agriculture and biomass for household energy, Malawi is highly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change and extreme weather events. This situation is exacerbated by increasing poverty among rural communities, increasing population pressure on a limited land resource base, land degradation arising from agricultural expansion and the cultivation of marginal lands, and increasing deforestation to meet the increasing demands for energy, food and construction purposes.

The Malawi Hazards and Vulnerability Mapping Project
One of the National Adaptation Programme of Action of Malawi priority areas of action to reduce the suffering of the most vulnerable communities was to improve community resilience to climate change through the development of sustainable livelihoods. In order to achieve this, the Government of Malawi requested RCMRD through the SERVIR program to facilitate national-level analysis and technical capacity building in spatial hazards and vulnerability mapping.

The government through the Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA) brought together stakeholders from key agencies including the Survey and Mapping department, the Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services, the National Statistics Office, Ministry of Agriculture, Department of Water Resources, Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, United Nations Development Programme, the World Bank and the World Food Programme among others to develop a national hazards and vulnerability atlas and a geo-database to help the government and development partners identify areas of priority for resilience building to climate change.

Methodology for Creating the Indicators and Vulnerability Components
The hazards prioritized for mapping under this work are well captured in the exposure component of spatial vulnerability mapping. This component captures the relative occurrences of the main climate related hazards prioritized for this work. The spatial vulnerability indices are categorized following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) conceptual framework, which separates vulnerability into three components: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to climate stressors. The approach presented here was to map the generic vulnerability of the population rather than to develop separate vulnerability layers for individual systems (e.g., ecosystems); sectors (e.g., water or agriculture); or population sub-groups (e.g., pastoralists). Every quantitative vulnerability assessment clearly identifies its focus, the attribute of value, the external hazards of concern, and its temporal reference. This mapping is defined as follows:

Focus: vulnerability of populations to food and livelihood insecurity
Valued attribute: food security, health, and wellbeing
External hazards: changes in rainfall and increasing temperatures that threaten agricultural production systems, and occurrences of climate related hazards (floods, droughts, forest fires, and climate sensitive diseases with a focus on malaria)
Temporal reference: focus on 2010 as baseline year from which the most comprehensive socio-economic survey; the Third Integrated Household Survey (IHS3) was carried out in Malawi
Download the atlas (found under the 'Downloads' section) to read more about the spatial indicators utilized (Table 2). The guiding approach was to identify a limited number of high-quality spatial data sets that best represent the component of interest while avoiding the temptation to add low-quality data (data of high uncertainty or coarse spatial resolution).

An averaging/additive approach was used to develop these indices. When using this approach, a first step is normalization of the indicators. Owing to problems of incommensurability in measurement units of the raw data, the values for each layer need to be normalized (or transformed) to a consistent ordinal or unit-less scale (e.g., drought frequency or poverty levels on a scale from 0 - 100, from lowest to highest. The rescaled indicator layers are then averaged or added together to come up with component and vulnerability scores. The IPCC definition of vulnerability is the most frequently used framework, and one advantage of this approach is that separate maps for each vulnerability component (e.g., into exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity) can help decision makers to analyze adaptation options. This approach assumes a linear relationship amongst indicators and the component of vulnerability being measured.

Interpreting the maps
The five quantile classification method groups areas on the map from very low to very high. These classes and their descriptions show the severity of the component being measured e.g., very high exposure, very low lack of adaptive capacity etc. For indicator maps, the scale represents the severity of the vulnerability component being measured by that indicator.

The following Indicators where high values in the raw data are associated with low vulnerability were inverted: Education level of mother, Health services, Literacy levels and Irrigated areas (adaptive capacity).

The term 'Lack of Adaptive Capacity' is used in place of Adaptive capacity as a result of this inversion so that 'Very Low Lack of Adaptive Capacity' means 'Very High Adaptive Capacity' while 'Very High Lack of Adaptive Capacity' means 'Very Low Adaptive Capacity'. Consequently, for all the indicators under each of the three vulnerability components (exposure, sensitivity and lack of adaptive capacity), 'Very High' means very high scores for the vulnerability component being measured by that indicator. For example, very high and very low scores for Precipitation trend under the exposure component means very high and very low exposure as a measure of precipitation trend respectively. Very high and very low scores for soil organic carbon under the sensitivity component means very high and very low sensitivity as a measure of soil organic carbon respectively. Very high and very low scores for market accessibility under the lack of capacity component means very high and very low lack of adaptive capacity as a measure of market accessibility respectively.

The Tool
This Hazards and Vulnerability modeling tool has been developed in conjunction with the atlas and the geo-database to facilitate the dissemination of products from this project including maps, atlas document, and data developed (raw and processed) during the course of the project. Further, this tool enables users to export maps in PDF and print them as wall maps and or, maps for reports and gives users the ability to model vulnerability domains (exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity) to generate custom vulnerability maps. Finally, during disaster periods, users with access to the photo upload functionality will be able to upload photos of situations on the ground for access to relief and emergency responders in near real-time.
